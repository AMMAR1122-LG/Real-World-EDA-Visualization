## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset used is the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset**, which contains features computed from digitized images of a breast mass. It includes the classification of tumors into **malignant** or **benign**.

- **Target:** Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
- **Features:** Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.

## 📊 Key Visualizations Included

| Visualization Type | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| 📌 **Count Plot** | Show distribution of malignant vs benign |
| 🧮 **Heatmap** | Highlight feature correlations |
| 🧬 **Pairplots** | Identify patterns across variables |
| 📦 **Boxplots** | Detect outliers and spread of features |
| ⚖️ **Distribution Plots** | Understand skewness and density |
